This library is made for who wants to conduct experiment, and organize them and their results.
There will be the possibility to store every test on the experiments in chronological order, to save tags, to comment the results and the parameters. 
There will be the possibility to organize the running of all the test, and to parallelize the running of the different running.
There will be also an utility for plot the results and plot comparison between results. The plot will be either images or videos.
